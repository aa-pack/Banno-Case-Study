# Business Activities:

* What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?

There are many medium to large sized regional banks and Credit Unions that need to stay competitive with the big 4 banks (JP Morgan, Well Fargo, Citigroup, Bank of America) but don't have the capital to invest heavily in the digital channel. Ultimately, it is more profitable for these financial institutions to partner with a FinTech that specializes in digital banking instead of trying to architect and maintain their own solutions.  

* Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers? What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer? (What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)

The company's intended customer are banks and credit unions that need to either undergo a digital transformation or enhance their current digital banking offerings. According to the Institute for Self-Reliance, this cohort includes 41% of the total bank market share for the United States.[^1] Banno offers a full digital banking platform that also includes an integrated content management system (CMS) for the financial institutions public website, integrated marketing tools to deliver ads in both online banking and through the CMS, and a back office product that seamlessly ties all the systems together.[^2] Additionally, they have focused a substantial amount of resources into their chat feature, which allows users to communicate through an authenticated channel to their financial institution and upload documents, complete forms, and send transaction data very easily.[^3]

* Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them? (This may take a little bit of sleuthing–– you may want to search the company’s engineering blog or use sites like Stackshare to find this information.)

They currently use standard web based technologies and a Java stack, although for their targeted marketing tools they are employing machine learning and AI systems to improve it's personalization abilities. Their integration with Geezeo also uses OCR, machine learning, and AI to properly categorize people's transaction history and spending habits.
