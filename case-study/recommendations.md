# Recommendations

* If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer? (This could be something that a competitor offers, or use your imagination!)

Tailored lending, such that personalized financial product offerings can be displayed to and redeemed by customers in an authenticated channel. Ultimately I believe that creating a decision engine that can not only determine the best financial product to offer a user based upon their credit data, similar to what Credit Karma currently does [^1], but also control the modality in which it is presented and redeemed and do so frictionlessly would be greatly successful.  

* Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?

I think this offering would be greatly successful because it would empower financial institutions to achieve better conversion rates on their marketing and lending initiatives; this in turn would also help the financial institutions achieve a higher return on investment from Banno.

* What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?

Machine Learning, AI, APIs, and potentially a block chain architecture. Banno could use all their financial institutions member's data get a more cohesive picture with big data analytics at work.  

* Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?

There are millions of data points that are associated with any individuals financial data, and when scaled to millions of users, there are trillions of data points that need to be made into actionable insights and in an automated fashion. The technologies I mentioned in the question above make this possible.
